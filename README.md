# WeatherForecast

This program applies linear regression to forecast the weather of the next day given past temperature data.

-- temperature_forecast uses sklearn and applies the linear regression function to find the line of best fit.
-- temperature_forecast_GD uses the gradient descent algorithm to optimize the cost function and then find the line of best fit.

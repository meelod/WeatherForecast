# WeatherForecast

This program applies linear regression to predict weather temperatures given past temperature data.

-- temperature_forecast uses sklearn and applies the linear regression function to find the line of best fit.  
-- temperature_forecast_GD applies a vectorized implementation of the gradient descent algorithm to optimize the cost function and find the line of best fit.
